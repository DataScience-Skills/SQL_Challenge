- [4] Version control with GitHub with regular commands to update version: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- [5] Use QuickDBD to generate database design
- [6] Build database in PgAdmin4 according to database design
- [7] Import data to database 
- [8] Execute queries to return desired information from database
- [9] Write project contextual information and workflow in README.md
