# SQL Data Modeling, Engineering, and Analysis

## Background
In this exericse, you take on the role of a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, exploring and analyzing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. You are using the tool [PgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to build, and manage a database as well as manually import CSV files and run queries to retrieve the following information:

## Workflow
- [0] Fix errors as they arise
- [1] Find data (e.g. - CSV files)
- [2] Create project directory folders
- [3] Gain access to necessary tools, remoately installed locally (VSCode, PgAdmin4, PSQL, QuickDBD, GitHub)
- [4] Version control with GitHub with regular git add, git commit, and git push commands
- [5] Use QuickDBD to generate database design
- [6] Build database in PgAdmin4 according to database design
- [7] Import data to database 
- [8] Execute queries to return desired information from database
- [9] Write project contextual information and workflow in README.md
- [10] Write answeres to exeucted queries in answered-question.md
